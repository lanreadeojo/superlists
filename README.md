Using test driven development to develop a web-app.This paradigm uses functional and unit tests to guide our app developement. For each unit test we develop we develop source code to resolve the error generated by a failed test. For each user function/experience of the web app we develop functional tests for which we run unit tested source code to validate the functional tests.
