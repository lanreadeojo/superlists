Web-app development using test driven development.Functional and unit tests guide our app developement. 

For each unit test we develop we iteratively develop source code to resolve the error generated by a 
failed test. 

For each user function/experience of the application, we develop functional tests for which we run valid unit tested source code to validate the functional tests.
